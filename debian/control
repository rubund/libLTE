Description: LTE software suite for software defined radios (metapackage)
 This software enables running a full end-to-end, open-source LTE system. It
 contains a UE, eNB and EPC implementation.
 .
 For running a full network, also an implementation of the Evolved Packet Core
 (EPC) is needed.

Description: Evolved Node B in LTE network for Software Defined Radios
 This software enables running a "base-station" for an LTE network.
 .
 For running a full network, also an implementation of the Evolved Packet Core
 (EPC) is needed. (such as nextepc)
 .
 It contains the evolved Node B (eNB) component of the network.

Description: User Equipment implementation for LTE
 This software enables using a software defined radio as the user equipment
 connecting to an LTE network.
 .
 srsue provides a complete SDR LTE UE application featuring all layers from PHY
 to IP.
 .
 For running an LTE network, 'srsenb' should be used instead.

Description: Light-weight LTE core network implementation
 Together with 'srsenb', this software opens up the possibility to run an LTE
 network using a software defined radio.
 .
 It is a lightweight alternative to tools such as nextepc.

Description: Common files for srsLTE
 This software enables running a full end-to-end, open-source LTE system. It
 contains a UE, eNB and EPC implementation.
 .
 For running a full network, also an implementation of the Evolved Packet Core
 (EPC) is needed.
